### pt 3 questions
1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature, because it has a lot of features that likely interact with other parts, and designing a test suite around it would be probably impossible and definitely quite impractical.
2. I would, because it's easy to test and has clear criteria for "working" and "not working".
